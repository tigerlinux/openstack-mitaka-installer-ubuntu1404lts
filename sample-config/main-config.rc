#
# DATABASE SECTION
#
# Choose the Database Flavor. By the moment, we only support mysql and postgres
#
# dbflavor = mysql | postgres
dbflavor="mysql"
#
# The following variable tell the installer if it should create the databases for
# all openstack services. If "dbcreate" is "yes", you must supply the root user and
# it's password. The installer asumes that no database software is installed, so the
# installer will take care of this task ONLY if the variable "dbinstall" is "yes".
# If you have access to an external database server, dbinstall should be "no".
# dbcreate="yes": All openstack related databases will be created in the selected
# database backend using the supplied user/password access to the server.
# dbinstall="yes": The installer will install the database software. If you use this
# option in "yes", also you MUST use "dbcreate=yes" and "dbpopulate=yes".
dbcreate="yes"
dbinstall="yes"
#
# Access information for MySQL

#
# Access information for PostgreSQL
psqldbadm="postgres"
psqldbpassword="P@ssw0rd"
psqldbport="5432"
#
#
# The following variable indicates the installer to "populate" the openstack
# databases (cinder, glance, keystone, etc.). If this is a new installation, wheter
# you use an external database server or not, you shoud use "yes" here.
# If this a reinstallation, use "no"
#
dbpopulate="yes"
# NOTA: If "dbpopulate" is "no", the "dbcreate/dbinstall" variables are overriden and
# no action is taken for database installation, creation or population.
#
# Here you define the database backend server IP address. You can use an IP or a FQDN:
dbbackendhost="192.168.50.12"
#
# DB Max connections. This parameter needs to be adjusted according to your available
# cores in your controller
# 64 cores = 2000
# 128 cores = 4000
# 256 cores = 8000
dbmaxcons="1000"

#
# MESSAGE BROKER SECTION
#
# You must install the message broker in the controller or in the controller-compute but
# never in a compute node.
# If this server is a pure controller or a controller-compute, the variable must be "yes",
# else, put "no".
messagebrokerinstall="yes"
# The IP or FQDN of the message broker (always fill this, no matter if you are installing
# a controller or a compute node).

# OPENSTACK TROVE
#
# Our default is to not install trove, but if you want to installit, set this to "yes". ONLY
# IN THE CONTROLLER
troveinstall="no"
# The controller IP of course.... ;)

# If you want to use CINDER as Database storage backend, set the following variable to "yes".
# if you let the variable as "no" (our default), trove will use locally base storage. This
# mean you should use a flavor with ephemeral disk along root and swap disk. Trove configures
# the database space in the extra disk (does not use the root disk for database storage):
trovevolsupport="no"
# Also, ensure the proper volume device (our default is vdb, considering a normal instance
# with vda as primary disk, vdb as ephemeral disk and vdc as swap disk). If you are using
# trove instances with local-based storage, the flavor must contain an ephemeral disk and
# swap disk. In this case, trovevoldevice must be vdb. If you plan to use trove with cinder
# based storage, the root disk will be vda, the swap disk will be vdb, and the cinder disk
# will take vdc. In this case, trovevoldevice must be vdc and your flavor should not contain
# an ephemeral disk. Just root and swap.
trovevoldevice="vdb"
# Trove default DataStore - Normally, mysql. Se trove documentation for other options, as trove
# support many database engines:

# strict.

# IMPORTANT NOTE:
# To make your life easier, this installer creates a sample trove-guestagent config file
# already prepared to work with your OpenStack environment. You'll find this at:
# /etc/trove/trove-guestagent.conf
# Use this config file in your trove datastore-related glance images !!. The file is prepared
# wot work with your default datastore (see "trovedefaultds" variable above) but you can adapt
# it to other datastores.

#
# OPENSTACK SAHARA
#
# Same as with heat and trove. By default we don't install them. If you want to include sahara
# in your cloud, set this yo YES. And again, install this in the controller or in dedicated
# sahara host
saharainstall="no"

# OPENSTACK DESIGNATE - EXPERIMENTAL
#
# We are including EXPERIMENTAL support for Designate. Please, read all the documentation

# by default inside your zone pool.

#
# Our installer provision designate TLD's from the file at: 
# http://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt
# but, you can add extra TLD's (normally not "legal" tld's) that you would like to define
# inside your organization. Note that you cannot create domains whose tld's are not defined
# into designate:
dnsextratlds="home dom bogus"
dnsextratldfile="/etc/designate/extra-tlds.txt"
#
# Optional feature: If you want, we can configure designate SINK service in order to
# auto-create DNS records in an specific DNS domain (designate managed)
# For this feature to work correctly, please choose "yes" in the following variable
# and supply the DNS domain that we will auto-create in Designate and configure in the
# SINK service:
dnssinkactivate="no"
dnssinkdomain="mydnsdomain.org"
dnssinkdomainemail="designateadmin@mydnsdomain.org"
# Only if you are using MySQL as DB backend. If for any chance, you have multiple
# designate hosts, put here the IP address of the extra hosts, space separated.

# SNMP MONITORING SUPPORT
#
# If you want to include snmpd monitoring, set the following variable to "yes". We include

# See /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf for more information

#
# OPENSTACK HORIZON
#
# NOTE: Here, all "slashes" must go escaped
